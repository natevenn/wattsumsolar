  <h6 class="help-header">What are Kilowatt Hours?</h6>
    <p class="help-text">
      Electricity is measured in kilowatt‐hours (kWh). One kWh of energy is equal to 1000 watt hours and will power a 100 watt light bulb  
       for 10 hours (100 watts x 10 hours = 1,000 watt‐hours = 1 kWh). To find out your annual KWh, visit your utility companies website and search under your account for annual KWh.
