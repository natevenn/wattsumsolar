    <p class="help-text">
The tilt angle is the angle from horizontal of the photovoltaic modules in the array. For a fixed array, the tilt angle is the angle from horizontal of the array where 0° = horizontal, and 90° = vertical. For arrays with one-axis tracking, the tilt angle is the angle from horizontal of the tracking axis. The tilt angle does not apply to arrays with two-axis tracking.

By default, PVWatts® sets the tilt angle to 20 degrees for a fixed system. If array type is switched to a one axis tracking system, the tilt angle is set to a default of 0 degrees. Often, users set the tilt angle to the latitude of the selected location. However, setting the tilt equal to the latitude does not necessarily maximize the net annual output of the system, as lower tilt angles favor peak production in the summer months and higher tilt angles favor lower irradiance conditions in the winter months. Designers often use a lower tilt angle to minimize the cost of racking and mounting hardware, or to minimize the risk of wind damage to the array.

In general, using a tilt angle greater than the location's latitude favors energy production in the winter and using a tilt angle less than the location's latitude favors energy production in the summer.

For a PV array on a building's roof, you may want to choose a tilt angle equal to the roof pitch. Use the table below to convert roof pitch in ratio of rise (vertical) over run (horizontal) to tilt angle.
